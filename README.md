# Lumos

Manage dev and build tools, their configuration, and commands in a single centralized repository.
Lumos aims to solve the multi-project maintenance fatigue by removing the following burdens across
all projects: config and dotfile management, multiple config patterns, up-to-date development
dependencies, continuous copy and paste, and more.

[Built on and powered by Beemo](https://github.com/beemojs/beemo).

Lumos is designed around Oriflame projects. _Use at your own risk._
